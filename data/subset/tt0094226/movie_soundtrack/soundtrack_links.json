      "reasoning": "Candidate 2 is the best match because its description explicitly links the track to 'The Untouchables' movie soundtrack, crediting the original composers (Duke Ellington, Irving Mills, Barney Bigard) and specifically mentioning 'arranged by Bob Wilber' and 'Ennio Morricone – «The Untouchables» (Music From The Motion Picture)'. This indicates it is likely the specific version used in the film or from its official soundtrack release. Furthermore, the description includes official labels like 'La-La Land Records, Paramount Pictures, Universal Music Special Markets 1987/2012', reinforcing its authenticity as the movie's soundtrack version. A crucial piece of evidence is that the video's duration (3 minutes 41 seconds) precisely matches the duration of 'Mood Indigo' on the official soundtrack album for 'The Untouchables'. While other candidates from 'Duke Ellington - Topic' channels also mention the movie, their descriptions are less specific about being the actual soundtrack recording, and their durations differ, suggesting they might be other recordings of the song rather than the definitive movie version.",
