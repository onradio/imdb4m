Most importantly, the video's auto-generated description from Masterworks/Sony Music Entertainment correctly identifies \"Lowell Mason\" as the composer and \"Sarah Adams\" as a composer (referring to lyrics), which directly corresponds to the soundtrack's composer and lyricist information. The producer \"Lorenze Hasler\" is also a near-perfect match for \"Lorenz Hasler\". This video is an official upload from the artist's topic channel, ensuring authenticity and high-quality metadata. Unlike Candidate 1, which incorrectly lists the composer as \"Traditional\", Candidate 3 accurately reflects the non-traditional nature and specific composer of the soundtrack.",
