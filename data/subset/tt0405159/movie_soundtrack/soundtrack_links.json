The description explicitly states 'Million Dollar Baby' as the movie, and correctly identifies 'Kyle Eastwood' as the Composer Lyricist and 'Michael Stevens' as the Composer Lyricist, aligning perfectly with the provided metadata. The video is an official upload, indicated by 'Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group' and being 'Auto-generated by YouTube' on the 'Clint Eastwood - Topic' channel, ensuring its authenticity as the official soundtrack version. While the metadata lists the performer as 'Unknown' and the video credits 'Clint Eastwood', this is a common practice for movie soundtracks where the director or a prominent figure associated with the film's music is credited for the album, even if the specific composition is by another artist (in this case, Kyle Eastwood, who is Clint's son). Given the precise matches for title, movie, composer, and lyricist, and its official source, this is undoubtedly the best match.",
