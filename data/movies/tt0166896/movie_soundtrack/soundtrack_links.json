However, this is a very weak match as the song title 'The Good Times Are Over' does not align with the target soundtrack title 'Happy Times'. There is no mention of the movie 'The Straight Story' in the video's metadata, and the video itself is a low-quality lyrics video with very few views and likes. All other candidates are completely unrelated to the target soundtrack in terms of both artist and song title, making Candidate 1 the least incorrect option by a narrow margin.",
