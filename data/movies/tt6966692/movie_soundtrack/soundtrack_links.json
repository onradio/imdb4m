      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because its description explicitly states \"Music featured in the Film 'Green Book'\", directly linking the song \"Let Me Feel It\" by Elgie Brown to the specified movie. This crucial piece of information is absent from all other relevant candidates. The video is also uploaded to an \"Elgie Brown - Topic\" channel, indicating an official or auto-generated release associated with the artist and publisher, which enhances its authenticity for the soundtrack.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Explicit mention of \"Music featured in the Film 'Green Book'\" in the video description.",
        "Perfect title match: \"Let Me Feel It\".",
        "The performer, Elgie Brown, is consistently identified across relevant candidates, and this video is on an official 'Elgie Brown - Topic' channel.",
        "Description includes official release indicators such as 'Provided to YouTube by IIP-DDS' and '℗ Profound'."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "The provided soundtrack metadata lists 'Performer: Unknown', while this video (and other strong candidates) clearly identifies Elgie Brown as the performer. However, given the explicit movie context in the description, it is highly probable that Elgie Brown is indeed the performer for the version used in the film, and the initial metadata might be incomplete or generic.",
        "The video has relatively low views and likes compared to some other candidates, but this is not uncommon for official topic channel uploads of specific soundtrack tracks."
