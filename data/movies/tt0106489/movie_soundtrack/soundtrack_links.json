      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the most authentic and high-quality match for the soundtrack. It is an official audio upload from the 'Aaron Neville - Topic' channel, which is typically auto-generated by YouTube for official music releases. This indicates it is the canonical studio recording of 'Tell It Like It Is' by Aaron Neville. While it does not explicitly mention 'A Bronx Tale' in its title or description, this is the definitive version of the song that would be licensed and used in the movie's soundtrack. The video's extensive metadata in the description (producers, publishers, release details) further confirms its authenticity. Its overwhelmingly high view and like counts also suggest it is widely recognized as the primary version of the song. The other candidates, while some explicitly mention 'A Bronx Tale', are clearly fan-made uploads with significantly lower quality, popularity, and official backing.",

        "The video title and description do not explicitly mention 'A Bronx Tale' or 'soundtrack'. However, this is a minor concern given the video's overall authenticity as the official recording of the song used in the film."
