This confirms it is the original studio recording of 'Oye Como Va' by Santana. Movie soundtracks almost exclusively use the original studio versions of songs, and since 'Carlito's Way' was released in 1993, the 1970 recording is the historically accurate and most probable version used in the film. The other candidates are either live performances (Candidates 1 and 5) or a modern collaborative re-interpretation (Candidate 3), making them less suitable for a movie soundtrack match. While Candidate 4 is also an official audio track by Santana, Candidate 2's description provides more definitive historical context regarding the original release year, which is crucial for a soundtrack match.",
