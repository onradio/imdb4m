Crucially, its title, 'If We Hold On Together (From \"The Land Before Time\" Soundtrack)', directly and explicitly links the audio to the specified movie soundtrack. The description further confirms the producer (Peter Asher) and composers (James Horner, Will Jennings), and the copyright year (1988) aligns perfectly with the movie's release. While its view count is low due to its very recent publication date, this does not diminish its authenticity or its direct relevance as the official soundtrack version. Other candidates are either live performances, unofficial uploads, or lack the explicit 'soundtrack' context in their titles/descriptions.",
