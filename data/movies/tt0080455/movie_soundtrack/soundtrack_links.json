This indicates it is the authentic, high-quality studio recording of 'Hold On, I'm Coming' by Sam & Dave. The movie 'The Blues Brothers' features this original studio version of the song on its soundtrack. Its high view count and likes further support its status as the canonical recording. While Candidate 3 explicitly mentions 'From Blues Brothers' in its title, its authenticity is highly questionable due to a future publish date, very low popularity, and being an unofficial lyrics video, making it an unreliable source for the actual soundtrack recording. Candidates 2, 4, and 5 are either a fan-made remix or live performances, which are generally not what is sought for a movie soundtrack's original recording.",
