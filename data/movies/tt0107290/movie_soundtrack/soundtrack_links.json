      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because its title, 'Las Gaviotas (Source)', strongly suggests it is the original recording used in the film. The channel, 'Film Music Studio', is dedicated to film music, further supporting its authenticity as a soundtrack piece. Crucially, the description mentions 'Music by Grupo de Amigos', which is the name of the band that performs this specific song within the 'Jurassic Park' movie. While the soundtrack metadata lists the performer as 'Unknown', 'Grupo de Amigos' is the recognized in-movie performer. Candidates 3 and 4 are clearly different recordings by unrelated artists with no connection to 'Jurassic Park'. Candidate 2, while explicitly mentioning 'Jurassic Park' in its title, is an extended ambient version (1 hour duration) rather than the original soundtrack recording itself, as indicated by its channel name 'Ambience fossil' and description.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Video title includes '(Source)', indicating it's the original film version.",
        "Channel name 'Film Music Studio' is highly relevant to film soundtracks.",
        "Description mentions 'Grupo de Amigos', the actual band performing the song in the 'Jurassic Park' movie.",
        "High view and like count compared to other relevant candidates, suggesting it's a recognized version."

      "concerns": [
        "The video description does not explicitly mention 'Jurassic Park', which would make the match even stronger.",
        "The performer 'Grupo de Amigos' is mentioned, while the soundtrack metadata lists 'Unknown'. However, this is a minor discrepancy as 'Grupo de Amigos' is the in-movie performer."
