      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the strongest match due to its explicit labeling as an 'Official Video' from a highly authoritative channel, SonySoundtracksVEVO. The title perfectly matches the soundtrack metadata, including the performer and movie context. The description provides excellent detail, confirming that the song was performed by Jos Slovick in the film '1917' and that this a cappella version was recorded and filmed at Abbey Road Studios. Its significantly higher view and like counts further indicate its status as the canonical and most recognized YouTube representation of this soundtrack entry. While its duration differs from other candidates, this is common for official music videos which may be edited or feature a specific performance.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Video title explicitly states 'Official Video' and includes performer and movie context.",
        "Uploaded by 'SonySoundtracksVEVO', indicating an official and authentic release from the record label.",
        "Description clearly links the video to the '1917' film and Jos Slovick's performance.",
        "Highest view count (over 8 million) and likes (over 187k) among all candidates, suggesting widespread recognition and authority.",
        "Detailed description provides context about the recording and filming of this specific version."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "The video's duration (3:58) is shorter than other candidates (around 4:50-4:52), which might indicate it's a specific music video edit or performance rather than the exact album track length. However, for a 'YouTube video match', an official music video is often preferred."
