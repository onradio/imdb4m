The video features a performance by 'The President's Own' United States Marine Band, which is widely regarded as an authoritative interpreter of John Philip Sousa's marches. This aligns well with the composer metadata. Its substantial view count and likes suggest it is a canonical or highly recognized recording of the piece. While the specific performer for the movie soundtrack is listed as 'Unknown', a high-quality, official recording by a prominent military band is a strong general match for the musical piece itself.",
