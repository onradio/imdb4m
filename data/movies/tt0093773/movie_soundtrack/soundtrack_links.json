      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Candidate 2 is the best match because it explicitly links the song 'Long Tall Sally' by Little Richard to the movie 'Predator' and even specifies the 'Helicopter Scene' where it is famously featured. This direct contextualization is crucial for matching a 'soundtrack from a movie.' While it is a fan upload, its title and description directly address the movie context, which is paramount for this task. Other candidates, though some are official music uploads, completely lack any mention of the movie 'Predator', making them less suitable for a 'soundtrack' match.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Explicitly mentions 'Predator' in the video title and description.",
        "Specifically references the 'Helicopter Scene', which is the iconic moment the song is used in the movie.",
        "Correctly identifies 'Long Tall Sally' as the song and 'Little Richard' as the performer.",
        "Provides direct movie context, fulfilling the 'soundtrack from a movie' requirement."
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "The video is a fan upload, not an official music release from the artist or a movie studio, which might imply varying audio quality or the inclusion of scene dialogue/sound effects rather than just the isolated music track."
