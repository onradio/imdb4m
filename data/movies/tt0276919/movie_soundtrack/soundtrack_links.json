It is an official upload from the 'David Bowie - Topic' channel, licensed by Parlophone UK, ensuring it is the canonical studio recording of 'Young Americans' by David Bowie. The title perfectly matches the song and performer, and its high view and like counts indicate it is the widely accepted version of the track. While it does not explicitly mention 'Dogville' in its description, official music uploads typically focus on the song's production and release rather than its use in specific films. The primary goal is to match the soundtrack (the music itself), and this video provides the best representation of the song.",
