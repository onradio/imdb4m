      "reasoning": "Candidate 4 is the best match primarily because its description and title provide strong contextual alignment with the movie 'Der Untergang', which is set during WWII and often features historical military music. The video is titled 'Deutsches Soldatenlied \"Die blauen Dragoner\"' and its description explicitly states the composer Hans Hertel and lyricist G.W. Harmssen, along with historical context ('Musik: Hans Hertel um 1910, Text: G.W. Harmssen 1914'). This aligns well with the soundtrack's 'Unknown' performer, as it suggests a historical or traditional recording rather than a modern artist's cover. The high view count also indicates it's a widely recognized version of the song. While no candidate explicitly mentions 'Der Untergang', Candidate 4's classification as a 'Deutsches Soldatenlied' makes it the most thematically appropriate choice.",

        "Composer 'Hans Hertel' is correctly identified in the video description.",
        "The soundtrack's 'Unknown' performer aligns better with a historical/traditional recording without a specific modern artist, as suggested by Candidate 4's user upload and lack of performer attribution.",
        "The video's title 'Deutsches Soldatenlied' and historical context in the description ('Musik: Hans Hertel um 1910, Text: G.W. Harmssen 1914') provide a strong thematic match for the movie 'Der Untergang'.",
