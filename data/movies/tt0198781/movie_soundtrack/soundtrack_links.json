The video is provided by Universal Music Group through an auto-generated 'Billy Crystal - Topic' channel, ensuring its authenticity and high audio quality. The title 'If I Didn't Have You' perfectly matches the soundtrack title, and the performers 'Billy Crystal' and 'John Goodman' are correctly identified. The description explicitly lists 'Monsters, Inc.' as the album and credits 'Walt Disney Records / Pixar Animation Studios', along with the correct composer (Randy Newman) and producers (Frank Wolf, Chris Montan), all of which perfectly align with the soundtrack metadata. While other candidates (2 and 3) are also official uploads of the same track, Candidate 1 stands out with significantly higher views and likes, indicating it is the most recognized and canonical version of the song from the movie's soundtrack.",

However, none of the provided candidate videos make any mention of 'Monsters, Inc.' in their titles, descriptions, or implied context. 'Bintang Kecil' is a very well-known traditional Indonesian children's song, and all candidate videos are clearly various renditions or covers of this popular children's song, often crediting 'Pak Dal' or 'Daldjono' as the composer. A quick search confirms that 'Bintang Kecil' is not part of the official soundtrack for Disney/Pixar's 'Monsters, Inc.' which was composed by Randy Newman. Therefore, there appears to be a significant discrepancy in the provided soundtrack metadata regarding the movie association.\n\nGiven this fundamental mismatch, no candidate video can be considered a good match for the *soundtrack from the movie Monsters, Inc.*. Candidate 1 is selected as the 'best match' only in the sense that it is a highly popular and clearly identified rendition of the song 'Bintang Kecil' itself, but it completely fails to meet the movie context requirement. The confidence is set very low to reflect this critical failure in matching the core metadata.",
