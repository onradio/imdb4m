      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "The candidate video accurately matches the soundtrack's title 'Bust a Move' and performer 'Marvin Young'. The video's title 'Young MC - Bust A Move' correctly identifies the artist, as Young MC is the stage name for Marvin Young, which is further confirmed in the video description. The description also correctly identifies the song as Young MC's 1989 hit. While the video itself does not explicitly mention 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' or its soundtrack context, it is the correct song by the correct artist, making it the best available match among the candidates.",

        "Exact song title match ('Bust a Move').",

      "concerns": [
        "The video's title and description do not mention 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', which is the movie associated with the soundtrack. This means it's not confirmed to be the specific version or context from the movie.",
        "The video is uploaded by a non-official channel ('shark5981') and has relatively low views and likes, suggesting it may not be the canonical or official movie soundtrack upload."
