It is an official, auto-generated upload from the 'Clint Eastwood - Topic' channel, explicitly stating 'Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group' and carrying the copyright '℗ 2004 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.', which confirms it as an authorized release from the rights holder. The video title, 'Blue Morgan (End Credits) (From \"Million Dollar Baby\")', perfectly matches the soundtrack's title and movie context. The description clearly credits Clint Eastwood as the Composer Lyricist, aligning with the provided soundtrack metadata. Its duration is consistent with a full track, unlike the shorter 'Opening Titles' version. While Candidate 2 has higher views, its unofficial channel and empty description make its authenticity questionable. Candidate 3 is also an excellent official match, but Candidate 1 is slightly favored due to being listed directly from the 'Million Dollar Baby' album rather than a compilation, and having a higher view count among the official releases.",
