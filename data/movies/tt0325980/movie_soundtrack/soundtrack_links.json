Furthermore, the description explicitly credits 'Additional Music By Craig Eastman', confirming the performer/composer. The mention of 'Recording Sessions' also suggests an authentic, official soundtrack piece. Candidate 2, while mentioning 'Craig' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean', appears to be a personal rendition or cover based on its channel and description, rather than the official soundtrack.",
