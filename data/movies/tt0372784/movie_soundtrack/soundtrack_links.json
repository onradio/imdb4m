Furthermore, the video's description explicitly lists both 'Ambrosian Opera Chorus' (which is synonymous with 'The Ambrosian Singers') and 'London Symphony Orchestra' as performers, along with Arrigo Boito as the composer, perfectly matching the provided soundtrack metadata for performer and composer. The video is also an official upload from Warner Classics, indicating high authenticity and quality. The primary discrepancy is the absence of 'Batman Begins' in the video's metadata, which is likely an error in the provided soundtrack's movie attribution, as 'Folletto, veloce, legger' is a well-known aria from Boito's opera 'Mefistofele' and not typically associated with the film 'Batman Begins' in this specific recording context.",
