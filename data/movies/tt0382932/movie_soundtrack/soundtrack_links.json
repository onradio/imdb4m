The video title is comprehensive, including the performer (Camille), composer (Michael Giacchino), song title (Le Festin), and movie context (From \"Ratatouille\"). The description explicitly states \"Music video by Camille, Michael Giacchino performing Le Festin (From \"Ratatouille\"). © 2007 Walt Disney Records/Pixar,\" confirming its authenticity and direct connection to the original soundtrack and rights holders. While other candidates have high views, they are uploaded by personal channels and explicitly state disclaimers or are clearly not the original soundtrack recording (e.g., a live performance). The official source and explicit copyright information make Candidate 1 the most reliable and authentic match.",
