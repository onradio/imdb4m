The description clearly identifies Sasha Lazard as the vocalist, directly matching the requested performer. While Candidate 1 also features Sasha Lazard and has a more complete title, its upload source is a generic user channel ('cossace'), lacking the official backing and metadata provided by Candidate 2. The official nature of Candidate 2, indicating a direct release from the artist's official distribution, makes it the most authentic and reliable choice, despite having fewer views than Candidate 1.",
