      "confidence": 0.98,
      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because it is an official audio upload directly associated with the original 1989 Walt Disney Records release of 'The Little Mermaid'. The title, composer, and lyricist all perfectly align with the provided soundtrack metadata. The performer credit 'Daughters of Triton · Disney' is consistent with how the original movie version, where specific individual performers are often uncredited, is typically attributed. The duration of 41 seconds is also characteristic of this specific track from the film. Its high view count further suggests it is a widely recognized and canonical version.",
