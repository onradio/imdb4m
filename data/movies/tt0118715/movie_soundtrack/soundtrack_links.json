While none of the candidates explicitly mention 'The Big Lebowski,' the 'Branded' Theme Song featured in the movie is indeed the original theme from the 1960s TV series. Therefore, finding the most authentic version of the TV theme is the closest match to the soundtrack's intent. Other candidates are either explicit tributes/covers (Candidates 1, 3, 4) or have very low popularity and suspicious metadata (Candidate 2's future publish date). Candidate 5 also has the highest views and likes, indicating it's a widely accepted version of the theme.",
