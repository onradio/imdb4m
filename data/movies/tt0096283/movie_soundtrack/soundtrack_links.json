The soundtrack title 'Sampo' is the Japanese name for the song 'Hey Let's Go' or 'Stroll' from 'My Neighbor Totoro', which is explicitly mentioned in the video title as 'Hey Lets Go (Stroll) -My Neighbour Totoro (English Ver.)'. The video's title and description clearly link it to the movie 'Tonari no Totoro' (My Neighbour Totoro). The 'English Ver.' in the video title aligns with the listed English performers (Cassie Byram, Sonya Isaacs) for the soundtrack. While it is a fan upload and doesn't explicitly name the performers, its high view count and likes suggest it is a widely recognized and accepted version of the song.",

        "The 'English Ver.' in the title matches the presence of English performers in the soundtrack metadata.",

The video is an 'Official music video by Joe Hisaishi' uploaded on the 'JoeHisaishiVEVO' channel, which signifies high authenticity and a canonical release. Joe Hisaishi is the composer of the soundtrack, making his official release highly relevant. While the soundtrack metadata lists 'Performer: Unknown', it is common for the composer to be credited as the primary artist for official soundtrack releases, even if specific vocalists are uncredited or part of an ensemble.
