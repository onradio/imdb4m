It is an official upload from the 'John Williams - Topic' channel, explicitly stating it is 'Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group' and copyrighted by 'Lucas Film Ltd.'. The video's title, 'Ewok Celebration and Finale', is a very strong match for the requested soundtrack 'Ewok Celebration', as this piece is often presented as part of a larger finale suite in official releases. The description accurately credits John Williams as the composer, producer, and conductor, and mentions the London Symphony Orchestra, aligning perfectly with the soundtrack's composer and movie context ('Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'). This ensures high audio quality and canonical status.",
