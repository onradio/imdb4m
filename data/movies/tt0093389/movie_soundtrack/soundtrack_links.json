The video title 'The Last Emperor - Auld Lang Syne (Soundtrack)' is a direct match to the requested metadata. Furthermore, the description provides specific contextual details from the movie, stating 'In the score when Johnston says farewell to Pu Yi', which strongly confirms its relevance to the film's soundtrack.

This is a minor inconsistency, likely referring to the song's origin versus the specific movie arrangement's production status, and does not undermine the strong movie-specific context provided by the video."
