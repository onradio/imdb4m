All candidate videos feature different titles, performers, and composers. Crucially, none of them mention the specific soundtrack title or the movie \"American History X\" in their metadata. While some candidates share thematic elements (e.g., \"rebel,\" \"white,\" \"skinhead\") that might broadly align with the controversial nature of Johnny Rebel's music or the movie's themes, this does not constitute a match for the specific soundtrack requested. Therefore, the confidence score is very low, indicating that no suitable match was found among the candidates. Candidate 1 is selected as the 'best_match_index' only to fulfill the schema requirement for an integer, not because it is a genuine match.",
