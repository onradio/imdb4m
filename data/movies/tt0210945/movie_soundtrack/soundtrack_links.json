All candidates feature different song titles. Candidate 2 is selected as the 'best' only because it correctly identifies 'The Temptations' as the performing artist, which aligns with the soundtrack metadata. However, the song title in Candidate 2 is 'Ain't Too Proud To Beg', not 'You've Got to Earn It'.",
