      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match as its title explicitly includes the song title 'Everything My Heart Desires', the performer 'Danielle Brisebois', and the movie context '(As Good As It Gets) Soundtrack'. The description further confirms its origin as being from the 'As Good As It Gets' OST movie. While Candidate 2 has more views, its title is less specific (lacking the performer's name), and its description is more generic. Candidates 3, 4, and 5 are either an acoustic version or entirely different songs ('My Only'), making them unsuitable.",
