The video's description explicitly states it is a 'tribute to \"A Ghost in the Shell\" original movie' and mentions 'Kenji Kawai,' who is the actual composer of the iconic opening theme ('Utai IV: Reawakening') for the 1995 'Kôkaku Kidôtai' film. While the soundtrack metadata lists 'Performer: Unknown' and 'Composer: Unknown,' and the video is a cover by Priscilla Hernandez, this candidate is the only one that correctly identifies and pays homage to the specific movie and its original musical source. The other candidates are either original music inspired by the anime (Candidate 2 and 3) or a soundtrack from a different adaptation (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex series) with a different composer (Candidate 4).
