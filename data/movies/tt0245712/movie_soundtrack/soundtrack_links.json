The video is uploaded by RHINO, a major record label, and is explicitly labeled 'Official Audio', indicating high authenticity and quality. It also has an exceptionally high number of views and likes, suggesting it is the canonical and most recognized version of the song. While the video's metadata does not explicitly mention 'Amores perros', the primary requirement is to match the specific soundtrack (song and artist), which this candidate does flawlessly. The absence of the movie context in the video's title or description is a minor drawback compared to the perfect match of the song itself, especially since none of the other candidates that mention 'Amores perros' actually contain the correct song.",
