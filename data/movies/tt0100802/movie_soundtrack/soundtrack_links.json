The video's description explicitly states 'Composer: Bruno Louchouarn' and mentions 'Total Recall (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)', aligning perfectly with the provided soundtrack metadata for composer and movie. Although the video is listed under 'Jerry Goldsmith - Topic' and includes 'Jerry Goldsmith' in its title, the detailed description clarifies Bruno Louchouarn as the composer for this specific track. This is a common occurrence for auto-generated YouTube topic channels where the primary score composer (Jerry Goldsmith for Total Recall) is often listed as the main artist for the album, even if individual tracks are composed by others. Given that Bruno Louchouarn is listed as both composer and performer in the soundtrack metadata, and he is confirmed as the composer for this track in the video description, this video is highly authentic and accurate for the specific soundtrack.",
