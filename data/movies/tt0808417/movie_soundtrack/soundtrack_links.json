Its title, \"Persepolis-Eye of the tiger par Chiara Mastroianni\", explicitly includes the movie title, song title, and the performer's name, which are the three most critical pieces of information from the soundtrack metadata. The channel name, \"ChiaraMastroianni\", further reinforces the performer's identity. While the video's duration is short (1 minute) and the description is uninformative, the strong title and channel alignment make it highly probable that this video features the specific version of the song by Chiara Mastroianni as heard in the movie Persepolis. The highest view count among the candidates also suggests its prominence.",
