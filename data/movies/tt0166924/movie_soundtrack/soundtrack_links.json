Crucially, the channel name 'David Lynch World' and the description referencing 'davidlynchworld.com' provide a strong contextual link to the movie 'Mulholland Dr.', as David Lynch is the director. This suggests the video is curated specifically for fans of the film and its director, making it highly probable that this is the exact version of 'The Beast' used in the movie. While not an official record label upload, its strong contextual relevance outweighs the generic nature of the official 'Topic' channel uploads (Candidates 4 and 5) and the lack of movie context in the most popular general upload (Candidate 3). Candidate 2 mentions the movie in its title but lacks the performer and has an empty description, making it less reliable.",
