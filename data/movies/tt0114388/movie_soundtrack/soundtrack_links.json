      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because its title perfectly aligns with all key metadata points: 'Jane Eaglen, Patrick Doyle - The Dreame | Sense & Sensibility (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'. This explicitly includes the performer (Jane Eaglen), composer (Patrick Doyle), song title ('The Dreame'), and movie ('Sense & Sensibility'), along with the crucial 'Original Motion Picture Soundtrack' designation. The video is uploaded by SonySoundtracksVEVO, which strongly suggests an official or authorized release of the soundtrack material. While there is a discrepancy in the description regarding the composer, the title itself, which is typically more carefully curated for official releases, correctly identifies Patrick Doyle. The other candidates are either piano covers (Candidates 3, 4, 5) or lack the comprehensive metadata and official channel presence (Candidate 2) to be considered the definitive soundtrack match.",
