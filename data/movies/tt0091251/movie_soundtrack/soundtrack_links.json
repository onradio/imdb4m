      "reasoning": "Candidate 4, 'Korobushka (Korobeiniki)' by Selin Gokova, is selected as the best match primarily because its metadata aligns most closely with the provided soundtrack information, particularly regarding the performer. The soundtrack specifies 'Performer: Unknown', and this video's title and description do not attribute the performance to a specific artist, which is consistent. In contrast, candidates 2, 3, and 5 explicitly name performers, making them less likely matches for a soundtrack with an 'Unknown' performer. Candidate 1 also lacks a specific performer, but Candidate 4 boasts significantly higher popularity (over 3 million views), suggesting it might be a widely recognized or canonical instrumental version of the song, which could plausibly be the uncredited version used in a film. While no candidate explicitly mentions the movie 'Idi i smotri', Candidate 4 offers the best fit based on the available textual metadata.",

        "No candidate video, including the chosen one, explicitly mentions the movie 'Idi i smotri' in its title or description, which is a major missing piece of context.",
        "The soundtrack metadata states 'Is Traditional: False', while the video description mentions 'russian folk'. This is a minor discrepancy, as 'Korobushka' is widely considered a folk song, but the movie's specific arrangement might not be strictly traditional."
