The provided soundtrack metadata, however, lists the performer as 'Unknown' and explicitly states the song is from 'The Princess Bride'. The video's description makes no mention of 'The Princess Bride' or any movie context. While Mandy Patinkin is associated with the movie, this specific recording is not presented as being from the movie's soundtrack. Therefore, it does not match the specific context of the soundtrack metadata provided, leading to a low confidence score.",
