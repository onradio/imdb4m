            schema:name "Creepy and scary horror feast with  plenty of gore ,  guts  and loads of blood" ;
            schema:reviewBody """Amusing and terrifying bloodfeast in which Ash/Bruce Campbell returns for a second round when he takes refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the people into evil demons until only Ashley J. Williams remains to battle the evil . This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell) , none too bright hero , who finds caught between scary monsters located into a ghastly cabin in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . As the lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holds up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack . As Ash along with his shotgun , and his chainsaw finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ and subsequently to confront a nasty witch . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . 

An eerie , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , and filled with primitive special effects , by using stop-motion technique . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous version ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating . Highly adequate make-up and appropriate special effects with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the eighties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . The producers insisted upon using different colors of blood to avoid an X rating , this proved futile, as the MPAA gave the film an X anyway ; after cuts, they received a more desirable R rating . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as improbable hero . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . This one is Bruce Campbell's favorite film of the trilogy ('The Evil Dead', 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', and 'Army of Darkness' in which Ash is hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time) . There appears cameo by Sam Raimi as the first Medieval knight to raise his sword and give his speech before hailing to Ash and the Zombified Henrietta was actually played by Sam Raimi's little brother , Ted Raimi . Thrilling as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Peter Deming , though most of the film was shot on a set built inside the gymnasium of the JR Faison Junior High School in Wadesboro, North Carolina . 

The motion picture was well directed by Sam Raimi , but many scenes were deleted from the movie and according to official reports, all of them and original version of the movie are lost . All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and compellingly directed by Sam Raimi . Its sequel was this ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) also starred by Sarah Berry , Dan Hicks , Kassie Wesley DePaiva , Ted Raimi , among others . And ¨Army of darkness¨ who finds Ash accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., as he is trapped in the middle ages where attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home ; this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were low-budget , it was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .""" ;
