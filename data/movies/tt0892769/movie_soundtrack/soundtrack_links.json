The video is uploaded by 'Jónsi - Topic', which is an auto-generated channel by YouTube for official artist content, and explicitly states it's 'Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group'. The description clearly links the song 'Sticks & Stones' to 'Jónsi' and the movie 'How To Train Your Dragon', including copyright information from DreamWorks Animation L.L.C. This indicates it is the official, high-quality audio track from the soundtrack. Its significantly higher view and like counts further support its status as the canonical version.",
