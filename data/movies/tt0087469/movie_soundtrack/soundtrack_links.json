      "reasoning": "Candidate 4 provides the most accurate and detailed match to the soundtrack metadata. Its description explicitly identifies the performer as Kate Capshaw (as Willie Scott) and specifies that the performance is in Cantonese, which is characteristic of the movie's opening scene. This level of detail is crucial for matching the specific version of the song from the film. While not an official upload, the comprehensive and correct information in the description, combined with a good title match, makes it the best representation of the specific soundtrack version. Other candidates either misattribute the performer (Candidate 2, listing John Williams instead of Kate Capshaw), are live covers by different artists (Candidate 3), or have suspicious details like a future publish date and generic description (Candidate 5). Candidate 1 is also a very strong contender, but Candidate 4's description adds a crucial layer of specificity about the performance (Cantonese, Willie Scott) that gives it an edge.",
