While all candidates are official audio uploads of the song by Édith Piaf, Candidate 1 stands out as the most widely recognized and authoritative version. The title and performer match perfectly with the soundtrack metadata. Although the composer/writer attribution in the description is slightly less precise than Candidate 5, it still includes the correct names. Given the absence of any direct movie context in any candidate, the most popular and officially recognized recording is the most logical choice for a soundtrack match.",

The video's title and description align perfectly with the song's metadata, including the lyricists.
