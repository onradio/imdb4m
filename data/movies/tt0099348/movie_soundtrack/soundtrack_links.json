      "reasoning": "Candidate 3 is the best match because its title explicitly states 'Dances With Wolves Soundtrack: Fire Dance (Track 12)', directly aligning with the requested soundtrack metadata. It has by far the highest views and likes among all candidates, suggesting it is the most recognized and widely accepted version of this specific track from the movie's soundtrack. The duration is consistent with other strong candidates, further supporting its authenticity as the soundtrack version. While it is a user upload and mentions John Barry for the overall score (which is correct for the movie), its clear identification as the 'Dances With Wolves Soundtrack' for 'Fire Dance' makes it superior to other options, especially Candidate 2 which, despite being an official artist upload, explicitly states it's from a different album ('Lost Frontier') and not the movie soundtrack.",

The video's title and description strongly suggest it is a traditional folk song, directly contradicting the soundtrack's 'Is Traditional: False' attribute.
