The target soundtrack is a 2 Tone ska song, while all candidate videos feature different artists and song titles, predominantly from the metal or rock genres. Candidate 3, 'Vintage Live Contents Under Pressure', was selected as the 'best match' only because its title contains the word 'Pressure', which is a keyword from the target soundtrack's title. However, the artist 'Vintage' is incorrect, the full song title 'Contents Under Pressure' is incorrect, and there is no mention of 'The Selecter' or 'The Abyss'. This selection is purely based on a very weak keyword overlap and does not indicate an actual match.",
