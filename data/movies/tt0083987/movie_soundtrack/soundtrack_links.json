Crucially, unlike several other candidates, it does not specify a particular performer in its main title or description, which aligns with the 'Unknown' performer listed in the soundtrack metadata. While none of the candidates explicitly mention the movie 'Gandhi', Candidate 2 provides a high-quality, widely recognized version of the classical piece itself, making it the most suitable general match when the specific movie recording is not identifiable.",
