The '℗ 2018 Lucas Film Ltd.' indicates an official release by the rights holder, likely a remastered version of the original recording. While other candidates are also official recordings by John Williams, they are either re-recordings with different orchestras or from different compilation albums, as indicated by their later copyright dates and specific orchestra mentions (e.g., Wiener Philharmoniker, Utah Symphony, Skywalker Symphony Orchestra). Candidate 1 is also very popular and high quality, but it is a more recent re-recording by the Wiener Philharmoniker, not the original film score.",
