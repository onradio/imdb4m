This is a significant drawback as the primary goal is to find a match for the movie's soundtrack. However, among the given options, Candidate 2 offers the most historically relevant and period-appropriate rendition of 'Just a Gigolo'. The movie 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is set in 1938, and Candidate 2 features a 1931 recording by Leo Reisman Orchestra. This makes it the most plausible candidate for a soundtrack that would feature a song popular in that era, even if it's not confirmed to be the exact version used in the film.

While John Williams composed the film's score and likely incorporated or arranged this march, the 'Königgrätzer Marsch' itself is a traditional German military march composed by Gottfried Piefke, not originally by John Williams. This is an imprecise attribution for the original piece, though understandable in the context of the film's score."
