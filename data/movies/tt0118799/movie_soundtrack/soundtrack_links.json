While the video's title \"Circus\" is incorrect, its description explicitly lists \"La vita è bella\" as one of the pieces performed in the concert. Crucially, the performing group is the \"Banda Musicale 'Giuseppe Gabetti'\", directly referencing the composer of \"Marcia Reale\". This combination strongly implies that the \"La vita è bella\" piece performed by a band named after Giuseppe Gabetti is indeed \"Marcia Reale\", which is the specific soundtrack requested. Other candidates either miss the movie context entirely (Candidates 1 & 2) or feature a different song from the movie (Candidate 4). Candidate 3 is completely irrelevant.",
