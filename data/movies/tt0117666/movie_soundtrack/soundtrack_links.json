It is an official audio upload provided by Universal Music Group, as indicated by the 'Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group' tag and the auto-generated '- Topic' channel. The video title 'Shenandoah' and the performers 'Daniel Lanois · Emmylou Harris' accurately match the soundtrack metadata. Crucially, the description explicitly states 'Sling Blade (Music from the Motion Picture)', confirming the correct movie context. The release year (1996) also aligns with the movie's release. While the provided soundtrack metadata lists 'Is Traditional: False' and 'Composer: Unknown', Candidate 2's description lists 'Composer Lyricist: Traditional'. This is a minor discrepancy, as 'Shenandoah' is a widely recognized traditional folk song, and the 'Is Traditional: False' in the prompt might refer to the specific arrangement or licensing for the movie rather than the song's original composition. Given the official nature of the video, its metadata is highly reliable for this specific recording. Candidate 1, despite a similar textual match, has extremely low views and a future publication date (2025), making it highly unreliable. Candidates 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect songs or performers.",
