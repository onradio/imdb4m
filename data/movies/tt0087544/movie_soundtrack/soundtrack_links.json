While it is a short, personal piano performance and not an official soundtrack upload, it correctly identifies the core elements of the soundtrack metadata.",

The video's description further clarifies that this song was used to promote the film as a symbolic theme, which perfectly matches the context provided. While it is a cover performance and not the original recording by Narumi Yasuda, it is the only candidate that accurately identifies the specific nature and purpose of the song as described in the metadata.
