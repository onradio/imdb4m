      "reasoning": "Candidate 4 is the best match because its description explicitly identifies the correct Vivaldi piece, 'L'Estate (Summer) Op. 8, No. 2 / RV 315 Concerto No. 2 In G Minor', which perfectly matches the soundtrack metadata. Crucially, it also directly links the video to the specified movie, 'Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (2019)', fulfilling the requirement of finding a soundtrack from that movie. While the video title is a common nickname for a movement ('Vivaldi - Storm'), the detailed description clarifies the full concerto title. Other candidates either feature incorrect music or lack the essential movie context.",

        "The video title 'Vivaldi - Storm' is a common nickname for a movement within L'Estate, rather than the full concerto title, though the description clarifies this.",
        "The video has a relatively low view and like count compared to other general classical performances, which might suggest it's not the most canonical or popular upload, but its direct link to the movie is paramount for this task."
