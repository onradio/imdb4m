The soundtrack metadata specifically requests a match for the soundtrack *from* the movie. The video's title 'Tombstone-Doc Holiday -Frederic Chopin- (Nocturne)' and description 'Holiday plays Frederic Chopin ..(Nocturne) \"Frederic Fucking Chopin\"...' directly reference the film and a memorable scene involving the music.

With over 78 million views and nearly a million likes, it is by far the most widely recognized and listened-to version among the candidates, suggesting it's a canonical or highly accepted recording of the classical piece. The soundtrack metadata lists the performer as \"Unknown,\" and Candidate 2's title and description focus on the composer and the piece itself rather than a specific, highly credited orchestra or conductor, which aligns well with the \"Unknown\" performer attribute. While other candidates offer official recordings by renowned orchestras (Candidates 1 and 3), their specific performer credits might make them less of a 'generic' match for an 'Unknown' performer. Candidate 4 is a specific live performance, and Candidate 5 is too short to be a full soundtrack piece.",
