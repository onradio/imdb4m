      "reasoning": "The candidate video's title 'Treyla-Wrong Path prod by Treyla' contains the phrase 'Wrong Path', which matches the soundtrack title. However, the performer 'Treyla' in the video title does not match the soundtrack's performer 'Craig Stull'. Furthermore, the video's description is minimal and provides no context linking it to the 'Dallas Buyers Club' movie or the specified composer/performer. The low view and like counts also suggest it is not the official or widely recognized version of the soundtrack. Overall, despite a partial title match, the video is highly unlikely to be the correct soundtrack.",
