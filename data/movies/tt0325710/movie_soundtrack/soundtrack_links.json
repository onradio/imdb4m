      "reasoning": "Candidate 2 is the best match because its title directly names the soundtrack 'Kagura no Netori' and explicitly states it's from 'The Last Samurai' soundtrack. The description further confirms this by listing 'Kagura no Netori (Tokyo Gakuso)' as track 4 in the 'The Last Samurai (2003) Recording Sessions Soundtrack' tracklist. The channel 'thelastsamuraiost' is dedicated to the movie's soundtrack, reinforcing the authenticity and relevance of the content. While Candidate 1 also mentions the track, Candidate 2's title is more direct in presenting 'Kagura no Netori' as the primary subject of the video. Candidate 15 contains the track but is a full soundtrack upload, not a dedicated video for this specific track.",
