The description explicitly states it's the 'Tema principal' (main theme) and 'Himno del Octubre Rojo' (Hymn to Red October), which is widely recognized as the core musical identity of the film and is often associated with or is the 'Payoff' track on the soundtrack. While it is a live orchestral and choral performance rather than the original studio recording, it captures the grandeur and essence of the soundtrack much more accurately than a piano cover or unrelated tracks. Its high view and like count also suggest it's a well-regarded and recognized rendition of the theme.",

Crucially, its description confirms the audio is 'from the soundtrack CD' and details the performance as the 'crew of Red October submarine sings', which perfectly aligns with the 'Unknown' performer in the soundtrack metadata and the specific context of the movie. The duration of 1 minute is also consistent with a specific scene's rendition of the anthem within the film. While Candidate 4 also has a strong title, Candidate 1's detailed description provides superior contextual authenticity for the specific movie soundtrack version.",
