      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because its title explicitly includes all key metadata: 'The Insider - Rites - Jan Garbarek'. This directly addresses the movie context, song title, and performer, which is crucial for a 'soundtrack from a movie' request. While it is a fan upload and lacks a description, the explicit title match for the movie context is paramount. Furthermore, its duration of 5 minutes and 35 seconds is consistent with a typical movie edit, which is often shorter than the full album version (as seen in Candidate 2 and 4, which are over 8 minutes). Candidate 2, while an official 'Topic' channel upload of the song, lacks any mention of 'The Insider' and presents the full album version, making it less specific to the movie soundtrack context.",

Although the soundtrack metadata lists the performer as \"Unknown\" and the video credits \"Richard Gilks\", it is common for films like \"The Insider\" to utilize pre-existing library music. The video's description indicates it's an official release from KPM Music Ltd, a prominent production music library, and was released in 1978, predating the 1999 movie, which aligns with the use of library tracks.
