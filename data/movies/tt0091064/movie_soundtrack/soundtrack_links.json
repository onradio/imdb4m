The description even offers links to purchase the movie and its soundtrack, reinforcing this contextual connection. While not an official upload, its primary focus is on presenting the song within the specified movie context, which is a critical aspect of the given soundtrack metadata.",

      "concerns": [
        "The video is likely a fan upload from an '80s Movies Soundtracks' channel, not an official release from the artist or record label.",
        "It has significantly lower views and likes compared to the official audio upload (Candidate 2).",
        "Candidate 1's description suggests the song was 'dropped' from the movie, which contradicts the provided metadata. While this video (Candidate 3) supports the metadata, the historical accuracy of the song's inclusion in the final film is a real-world concern, though for this task, we prioritize matching the provided metadata."
