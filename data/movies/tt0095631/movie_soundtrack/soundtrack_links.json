      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because it explicitly references 'Midnight Run - First scene'. The soundtrack 'Come Fly with Me' performed by Robert De Niro is famously featured in the opening sequence of the movie 'Midnight Run'. While the video title and description do not explicitly mention the song title or Robert De Niro as the performer, the strong contextual link to the movie's first scene makes it highly probable that this video contains the desired soundtrack. The other 'Midnight Run' candidates (2 and 3) are less specific in their content ('Funny Clips', 'short version') and lack descriptive detail. Candidates 4 and 5 are completely irrelevant, featuring a different artist and song.",
