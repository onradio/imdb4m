      "reasoning": "The candidate video features the song 'Beyond The Blue Horizon' and correctly attributes the composers (Leo Robin, Richard A. Whiting, W. Franke Harling), which aligns with the soundtrack metadata. However, there are critical mismatches. The video explicitly states it is from the movie 'Monte Carlo' and performed by Jeanette MacDonald, whereas the requested soundtrack is from 'The Godfather Part III' with an unknown performer. This fundamental discrepancy in the movie source and performer makes it a poor match for the specific soundtrack requested, despite the song title and composer alignment.",
