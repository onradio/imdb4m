It features the correct artist and song title, and its 'Remastered' status suggests a high-quality studio recording. The significantly higher view count (over 16 million) and likes (over 142,000) compared to other candidates indicate it is widely recognized as a definitive and popular version of the song.

      "reasoning": "Candidate 5 is the best match because its title, 'National Anthem of Germany: Deutschlandlied (full version)', directly and accurately reflects the soundtrack's title. The description explicitly names August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben as the lyricist, which is a perfect match with the provided metadata. While Joseph Haydn is not explicitly named as the composer in the description, the reference to 'the tune of the Austrian Imperial Anthem \"Gott Erhalte Franz den Kaiser\"' correctly identifies the melody's origin, which is Haydn's composition. The video's extremely high popularity (over 8.6 million views) suggests it is a widely recognized and canonical rendition of the anthem. The performer is not specified, aligning with the 'Unknown' performer in the soundtrack metadata. The duration of 3 minutes 56 seconds is also appropriate for a 'full version' of the national anthem.",
