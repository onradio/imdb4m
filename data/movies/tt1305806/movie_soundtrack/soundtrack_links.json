Its description accurately states that the soundtrack was 'scored by Emilio Kauderer and Federico Jusid', which correctly includes Emilio Kauderer, the specified composer for 'Tema de Liliana'. While the video title is generic ('Soundtrack') and does not explicitly name 'Tema de Liliana', the authenticity of the channel, the correct composer attribution, and its high popularity (nearly 200k views) strongly suggest it contains the original, high-quality recording of the soundtrack, including the requested track. Other candidates either misattribute the composer for the specific track (Candidate 1), are fan-made transcriptions (Candidate 3), or refer to different tracks from the soundtrack (Candidates 4 and 5).",

While the video title 'The Train Leaves' does not directly match 'Tema de Irene', it is a common occurrence for official soundtrack track titles to differ from popular or in-movie names. External knowledge confirms that 'The Train Leaves' is indeed the official title for what is widely known as 'Tema de Irene' from the movie, and it is composed by Emilio Kauderer.
