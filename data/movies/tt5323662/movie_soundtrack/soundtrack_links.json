This suggests the user is looking for a prominent or representative song from the movie's soundtrack, rather than a specific instrumental track named exactly 'A Silent Voice'. Among the candidates, Candidate 2, titled '【MAD】Koe no Katachi - Koi wo Shita no wa (恋をしたのは)', explicitly identifies its audio as 'Koi wo Shita no wa' by Aiko, which is widely known as the official ending theme song for the movie 'Koe no Katachi'. This makes it the most relevant and representative track from the movie's soundtrack among the given options. The other candidates are all AMVs (Anime Music Videos) that use unrelated popular songs (Line Without a Hook, Lovely, Fractures) overlaid with visuals from 'Koe no Katachi', and therefore do not represent the actual soundtrack music.",
