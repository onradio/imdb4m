Candidate 1, titled 'John Stafford Smith, The Star Spangled Banner', perfectly matches the song title and composer. While the video description identifies the 'United States Air Force Heritage of America Band' as a performer, it also includes 'Various Artists', which suggests a more generic or compilation context.

Other candidates feature highly famous and distinct performers (Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Eric Rogers Chorale) or very specific arrangements (marching band, college orchestra), which would likely be credited if used in a major film and thus contradict the 'Unknown' performer metadata more strongly.
