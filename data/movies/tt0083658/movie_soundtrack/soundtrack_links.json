It is uploaded on the 'Vangelis - Topic' channel, which is an auto-generated channel for official music releases, and explicitly states 'Provided to YouTube by EastWest U.K.' and 'Blade Runner (Music From The Original Soundtrack)'. The duration of 4 minutes and 56 seconds aligns with the original soundtrack version. While other candidates like Candidate 2 have higher view counts, Candidate 1's official source and clear metadata make it the most reliable and authentic representation of the soundtrack's 'Love Theme'. Candidate 3, also from a 'Vangelis - Topic' channel, is from a different album ('Nocturne') and has a significantly longer duration (6m6s), indicating it's a different arrangement or version, not the original soundtrack track. Candidate 4 is explicitly a 'time-stretched' version and thus not the original. Candidate 5 is a user upload, lacking the official backing of Candidate 1.",
