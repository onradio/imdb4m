Candidates 3, 4, and 5 are entirely irrelevant, featuring different song titles and artists. While Candidate 2 also matches the title, there is no definitive information to prefer it over Candidate 1, as both are auto-generated topic channel uploads of generic nursery rhyme versions. A significant concern is that neither Candidate 1 nor Candidate 2 provides any contextual information linking them to the movie \"Mary and Max.\", which is crucial for a definitive match. The soundtrack performer is listed as \"Unknown\", which is common for traditional songs where a movie might use a specific, uncredited arrangement. The metadata stating \"Is Traditional: False\" for \"Old Mother Hubbard\" is contradictory, as it is a well-known traditional nursery rhyme; this might refer to the specific recording not being a traditional folk performance. Given the strong title match but the critical absence of movie context, the confidence score is low.",
