The description specifically states 'Music From The Motion Picture' and lists official labels associated with the film's music release, such as Paramount Pictures and Universal Music Special Markets. Furthermore, it mentions the arrangement by Bob Wilber, which is a common characteristic of pre-existing songs adapted for film soundtracks, aligning well with the 'Performer: Unknown' detail in the provided soundtrack metadata, suggesting it's the specific movie version rather than a generic Duke Ellington recording. While other candidates mention the movie, none provide such detailed and direct evidence of being the official soundtrack version.",

        "The video is uploaded by a curated channel ('RetroPanorama') rather than an official artist or movie studio channel. However, the highly detailed and authoritative description mitigates this concern significantly."
