The description further reinforces this connection by stating 'Amazing Grace (From \"Big Fish\")' and crediting Mantovani as the performer and arranger. The 'Provided to YouTube by The Orchard Enterprises' indicates an official or licensed upload, suggesting authenticity for a movie soundtrack version. The soundtrack metadata's 'Is Traditional: False' implies a specific recorded version is being sought, which this candidate provides with a credited artist, rather than a generic traditional rendition. The other candidates either do not mention the movie, are different songs entirely, or are personal uploads without official movie context.",
