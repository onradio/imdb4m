While this is a crucial match, the video fails to meet other critical criteria: the performer is listed as 'DONALD PEERS' instead of 'Jackie Davis', and there is no mention of 'The Truman Show' in the title or description. All other candidates feature entirely different song titles, making them fundamentally incorrect matches for the requested soundtrack, even if some mention 'The Truman Show' in their context.
