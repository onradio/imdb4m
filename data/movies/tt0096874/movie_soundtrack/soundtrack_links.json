      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 provides a high-quality, full orchestral performance of Felix Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March' by a renowned orchestra (Berliner Philharmoniker) and conductor (Claudio Abbado). While none of the candidate videos explicitly mention 'Back to the Future Part II', this video represents a canonical and authentic rendition of the classical piece itself. Given that the soundtrack metadata lists the performer as 'Unknown', a high-quality, standard orchestral recording is the most plausible match for the musical content, even if it's not the exact recording used in the film. Other candidates are either piano covers, organ arrangements, or less authoritative/complete recordings.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Accurate title match ('Wedding March')",
        "Correct composer match (Felix Mendelssohn)",
        "High-quality orchestral performance by a reputable ensemble (Berliner Philharmoniker)",
        "Authentic and complete rendition of the classical work",
        "High popularity (views and likes) for a classical piece, indicating a widely accepted version"
      ],
      "concerns": [
        "No mention of 'Back to the Future Part II' in the video title, description, or channel, indicating it is not the specific recording from the movie.",
        "The performer is specified (Abbado / Berliner Philharmoniker), whereas the soundtrack metadata lists 'Unknown' for the performer, suggesting this is a generic performance of the piece rather than the exact movie version."
