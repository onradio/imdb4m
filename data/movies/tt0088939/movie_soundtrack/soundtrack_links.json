      "reasoning": "The candidate video is an excellent match for the soundtrack metadata. The video title, \"Don't Make Me No Never Mind (Slow Drag)\", is an exact match for the soundtrack's title. Crucially, the video's description explicitly credits Quincy Jones, James Ingram, and Roy Gaines as writers, which perfectly aligns with the composer and lyricist information provided for the soundtrack. This strong textual alignment across title and creative credits makes it highly probable that this is the correct track, even though the video's metadata does not explicitly mention 'The Color Purple'. Given the specificity of the title and the confirmed creative team, the likelihood of this being a different song with the same title and writers is extremely low.",
