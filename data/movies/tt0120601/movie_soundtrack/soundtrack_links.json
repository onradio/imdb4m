However, Candidate 2, 'Being John Malkovich OST - Future Vessel', is explicitly identified as an 'Original Motion Picture Soundtrack' track from 'Being John Malkovich' and attributes the composition to Carter Burwell, who is the actual composer for the movie's score. While this contradicts the 'Unknown' performer/composer and the title 'One', it is the most clearly labeled and popular dedicated soundtrack piece from the specified movie among the candidates. The other candidates are either different soundtrack titles with lower popularity or are movie clips rather than standalone soundtrack uploads.",

However, Candidate 2 is the only video that explicitly identifies itself as an 'OST' (Original Soundtrack) and mentions 'A great movie soundtrack...' in its description. This suggests that Les Hooper, the performer/composer of the requested soundtrack, is involved in creating music for films, which aligns with the nature of the request.
