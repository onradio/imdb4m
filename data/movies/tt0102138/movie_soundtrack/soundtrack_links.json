      "reasoning": "Candidate 5, 'Jerry Vargas - El Cubanito (1984)', is selected as the best match primarily due to its direct and unambiguous title match. While the soundtrack metadata lists the performer as 'Unknown', 'El Cubanito' is the closest song title among all candidates to the requested 'Cubanito'. The other candidates either feature 'Cubanito' as part of an artist's name for a different song (Candidates 1 and 4), include additional descriptive elements that make the title less direct (Candidate 2), or present a version with a very specific and potentially unrelated political context (Candidate 3). The 1984 release year of Jerry Vargas's 'El Cubanito' makes it chronologically plausible for inclusion in the 1991 'JFK' movie. However, the complete absence of any mention of the 'JFK' movie in the video's title, description, or channel context, and the discrepancy in the performer's name (Jerry Vargas vs. Unknown), significantly lowers the overall confidence.",
