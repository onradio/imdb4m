      "reasoning": "Candidate 2 is the best match due to its undeniable authenticity and comprehensive metadata. It is an official upload provided by Universal Music Group via the 'Lennie Niehaus - Topic' channel, which typically hosts official audio releases. The description explicitly states the movie 'Unforgiven', lists Clint Eastwood as the Composer Lyricist (matching the soundtrack metadata for composer), and Lennie Niehaus (matching the lyricist). The copyright information (℗ 1992 Warner Bros. Inc., under exclusive license to Varese Sarabande Records) further confirms its official origin and high quality. While the soundtrack lists the performer as 'Unknown', Lennie Niehaus was the orchestrator and conductor for the film's score, making his association with the track highly relevant and authentic. The duration of 5m42s is consistent with the main, full-length version of the theme, unlike Candidate 5 which is a much shorter version.",

        "The soundtrack metadata lists 'Performer: Unknown', while the video description lists 'Lennie Niehaus · Clint Eastwood' as associated with the track. However, given Niehaus's role in the score's production, this is a strong indicator of authenticity for the recording itself, rather than a discrepancy."
