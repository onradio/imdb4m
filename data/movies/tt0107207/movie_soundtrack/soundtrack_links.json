    "match_score": {
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Candidate 2 is the best match because it features the correct performer, Thin Lizzy, and the correct song title, 'Whiskey In The Jar', as specified in the soundtrack metadata. Crucially, it is an 'Official Audio' uploaded by the 'Thin Lizzy Official' channel, ensuring authenticity and high quality. While it does not explicitly mention 'In the Name of the Father' in its title or description, this is a lesser concern compared to candidates that feature the wrong artist, even if they mention the movie. Candidate 3, for instance, explicitly mentions the movie but attributes the song to 'LA Session Musos', which is a fundamental mismatch with the required performer 'Thin Lizzy'. The primary criteria of matching the artist and song title are met perfectly by Candidate 2.",
