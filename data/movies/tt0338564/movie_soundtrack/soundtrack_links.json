The title of the video directly includes \"被遺忘的時光【無間道 電影插曲】蔡琴\", leaving no ambiguity. All other candidate videos are for the main theme song of Infernal Affairs, performed by Andy Lau and Tony Leung, which is a different track from the one specified in the soundtrack metadata.",

The title explicitly identifies the song as 'Infernal Affairs OST' and correctly lists 'Andy Lau & Tony Leung' as performers. The description provides excellent context, explaining that it's the themesong of the 'Infernal Affairs trilogy' and how the lyrics relate to the characters' perspectives, which is highly relevant for a movie soundtrack. The inclusion of '粵' (Cantonese) and English/Romanization further enhances its quality as a fan-made production. Its high view and like count suggest it is a widely accepted and well-regarded version by the community.",
