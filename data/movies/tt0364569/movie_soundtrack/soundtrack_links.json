      "reasoning": "Candidate 1 is the best match because its title and description explicitly link the track to the 'Oldboy OST' and specifically identify it as 'track 9' and 'winter 1st mvt.' of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. This directly aligns with the provided soundtrack metadata, which specifies 'Winter' by Vivaldi from the movie 'Oldeuboi'. The duration of the video (3M8S) is also consistent with the first movement of Winter as typically used in film scores. Furthermore, it has significantly higher views and likes compared to other candidates that also mention the movie, indicating it is a widely recognized version of the soundtrack piece.",
