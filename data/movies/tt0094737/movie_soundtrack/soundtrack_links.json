Candidate 4 and 5 are completely irrelevant in terms of title and content. Candidate 1 is selected as the 'best match' only because its title 'Helper Bee' is the closest partial match to the soundtrack title 'Be a Helper Bee' and it has the highest view count among the partially relevant candidates, though this does not indicate it is the correct movie soundtrack.
