      "reasoning": "Candidate 4 is the best match because it is the only video that explicitly references 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' in its title. The soundtrack metadata specifically requests the version from this movie. While other candidates offer high-quality or popular renditions of 'Amazing Grace' with bagpipes, they lack the crucial movie context. The description of Candidate 4 also mentions 'Music by James Horner,' who composed the film's score, further strengthening its connection to the movie soundtrack. The movie's version of 'Amazing Grace' is famously performed with bagpipes, so the 'Scottish Bagpipes' aspect is implicitly covered by the movie context.",
