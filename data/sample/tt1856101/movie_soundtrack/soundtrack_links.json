      "reasoning": "Candidate 4 is the official audio upload of 'Suspicious Minds' by Elvis Presley from the artist's VEVO channel. This is the canonical, high-quality recording of the song that was used in 'Blade Runner 2049'. While the video's title and description do not explicitly mention 'Blade Runner 2049', this is common for official releases of licensed tracks that appear in various films. The immense popularity (over 128 million views) and official channel status confirm its authenticity and definitive nature as the soundtrack's core component. Other candidates either contain incorrect information (Candidate 1), are unofficial uploads with very low engagement (Candidates 2, 3, 5), or are incomplete (Candidate 5). The authenticity and quality of the official track outweigh the explicit movie mention found in less reliable sources.",
