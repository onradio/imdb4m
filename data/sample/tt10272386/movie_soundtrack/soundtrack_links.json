Most importantly, the description specifies that this is the 'Casta diva (La Scala, 1960)' recording with the 'Coro del Teatro alla Scala di Milano' and 'Conductor: Tullio Serafin'. This specific 1960 La Scala recording conducted by Tullio Serafin is widely recognized as the version featured in the movie 'The Father'. While Candidate 1 is also a Maria Callas performance of 'Casta Diva' and is more popular, it is a different recording (Paris, 1958) and does not match the specific version used in the film as closely as Candidate 2.",

        "Exact title match including 'Coro' (Chorus)",
        "Correct performer (Maria Callas) and composer (Vincenzo Bellini)",
        "Description explicitly identifies the 1960 La Scala recording conducted by Tullio Serafin, which is the version used in 'The Father' movie",

        "The video description does not explicitly mention 'The Father' movie, which is common for pre-existing classical recordings used in films.",
        "Lower view count compared to Candidate 1, but this is outweighed by the precise match of the specific recording details."
