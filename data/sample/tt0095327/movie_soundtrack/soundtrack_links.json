      "reasoning": "All candidate videos feature the correct song title, 'Gunkan March' (Gunkan kôshinkyoku), which is a direct translation of the soundtrack title. However, a significant concern is that none of the videos, their descriptions, or titles provide any specific context linking them to the movie 'Hotaru no haka' (Grave of the Fireflies). 'Gunkan kôshinkyoku' is a widely known Japanese military march, and numerous recordings exist. The videos are all from the same channel, 'Eiji's Imperial Broadcast', presenting different 'rare versions' of the march. Without any explicit connection to the movie, it's impossible to definitively identify any of these as the specific soundtrack version used in 'Hotaru no haka'. Candidate 2 is chosen as the 'best' among a set of equally unconfirmed options primarily due to its slightly higher popularity (views and likes) compared to the other candidates, which might suggest it's a more recognized or preferred recording of the march, though this does not confirm its use in the movie.",
      "key_factors": [
        "Video title 'Gunkan March' directly matches the soundtrack title 'Gunkan kôshinkyoku'.",
        "The soundtrack performer is listed as 'Unknown', and the candidate videos do not specify a performer, aligning with this metadata.",
        "Candidate 2 has the highest number of views and likes among all the provided options, suggesting it might be a more prominent recording of the march."

      "concerns": [
        "None of the candidate videos explicitly mention 'Hotaru no haka' or 'Grave of the Fireflies', making it impossible to confirm if any are the specific version used in the movie's soundtrack.",
        "The videos appear to be generic recordings of a popular military march, not necessarily official soundtrack uploads or the exact version featured in the film.",
        "All candidates are very similar, originating from the same channel and differing mainly in their 'rare version' number and popularity, offering limited distinguishing factors for a definitive movie soundtrack match."

      "reasoning": "Candidate 3 is the best match because it perfectly aligns the song title, performer, and crucially, the movie context. The video title explicitly includes 'Grave of the Fireflies', and the description directly states that 'Her version of this song features in the Studio Ghibli film \"Grave of the Fireflies\"'. Furthermore, the description highlights the authenticity of the recording by mentioning it's an 'original 78 recording played on an HMV... Gramophone', which is highly relevant for a historical soundtrack. While not an official digital release from a major label, this presentation of the authentic historical recording directly linked to the film makes it the most contextually accurate and relevant choice among the candidates.",
