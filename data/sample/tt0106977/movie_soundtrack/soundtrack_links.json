The video title 'The Thrill Is Gone (Live In Los Angeles,1976)' directly matches the soundtrack's song title and features both B.B. King and Bobby Bland as performers. Crucially, its description explicitly lists Roy Hawkins and Rick Darnell as Composer/Lyricist, which perfectly aligns with the provided soundtrack metadata. While it is a live version and not explicitly linked to 'The Fugitive' movie, it is the most precise and authentic representation of the specified song and artists among the given candidates. Candidate 3 is also an official upload with matching composers, but it is a 'Medley' which makes Candidate 5 a more direct match for the standalone song title.",

The video title 'Tahiti, Tahiti…' is an almost exact match to the soundtrack title 'Tahiti Tahiti'. Furthermore, the detailed description within the video's metadata accurately lists the main performer 'Voyage' and key contributors such as Sylvia Mason (close to Sylvia Mason-James), Pierre-Alain Dahan, Marc Chantereau, and Slim Pezin, who are all mentioned in the soundtrack metadata as performers, composers, or lyricists. The producer 'Roger Torkaz' in the video description is also a very close match to 'Roger Tokarz' from the soundtrack metadata, likely a minor spelling variation. The high view count and likes further support its status as a canonical version of the song. Other candidates either feature a different song ('Souvenirs') or are unofficial uploads with very low engagement.",
