Crucially, its description explicitly lists Walter Maioli as composer and Natalia Van Ravenstein (a variant of Nathalie Van Ravenstein) as composer, directly matching the provided composer and lyricist information for the soundtrack. It is an official upload from the \"Synaulia - Topic\" channel, provided by the record label Amiata Records, ensuring authenticity. While it does not explicitly mention \"Gladiator\", this is a common omission for pre-existing tracks licensed for film use, and the other official Synaulia uploads also lack this context. The album release date of 1996 predates the movie's release in 2000, making it a plausible original source for the track used in the film.",
