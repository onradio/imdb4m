All candidates are different artists performing the song 'I Cover the Waterfront'. Candidate 1, featuring Lester Young, is selected as the 'best' only because it is a widely recognized jazz rendition of the song, and its description accurately credits Johnny Green and Edward Heyman as the original composers and lyricists. This makes it the most relevant to the song's core identity among the given options, despite being the incorrect specific soundtrack version.",
