The soundtrack is 'There'll Be A Hot Time In The Old Town Tonight' performed by Jack Nicholson from the movie 'Batman'. All candidate videos are completely unrelated: Candidates 1, 2, and 3 are radio jingles; Candidate 4 is a talk show clip featuring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; and Candidate 5 is an official music video by P!nk.
